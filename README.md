This is a simple script that will dig DNS records for a list of domain names.

The script will create a new folder for each domain name.

Inside the domain name folder will be a dated txt file with the current DNS records.

The 'dig' command is needed for this script to work.

To install dig:
```
sudo pacman -S dig
```
